# Search for someone

## Work in Progress

This script will (if you desire to) grab your followers and/or followees and search all of their followers and followees accountnames for a string that you define. 

Plan:

  * Refine the get_followers and get_followees scripts
  * create the script to scan the followers and followees
  * merge everything into the main script 
  * ad the user inputs and options
  * test, try, clean, sleep, repeat
  * figure out how to create a session trough the script
  * Refine and check everything

I just had the crazy idea to combine it to create a chart wich will visually show who follows who.
(Kind of like https://github.com/KiranGershenfeld/VisualizingTwitchCommunities did)
This will take a wile since im pretty busy rn...
