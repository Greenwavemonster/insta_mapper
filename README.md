*UPDATE June 2023:* The Projects is unfortunatly dead. Meta changed some backend stuff which causes instaloader to fail while trying to fetch data because its tryes to fech a non avaiavle file. Also I get logged out after few requests. Since I dont wanna lose my insta accounts imma stop right here. sorry

*UPDATE December 2022:* Sorry don't expect much here anymore. I just don't have enough time + i kinda got shadowbanned by Meta because it always auto logs me out after just few requests (probably because I sent too many requests in the past)


# Search for someone

NOTE: I am currently not in active developement of this script due to lack of time however the download Followers / Followees works and can be used. The "Plan" mentioned below will probably be developed in like 40 years when im retired... sorry :)

## Work in Progress

This script will (if you desire to) grab your followers and/or followees and search all of their followers and followees accountnames for a string that you define. 

Plan:

  * Refine the get_followers and get_followees scripts
  * create the script to scan the followers and followees
  * merge everything into the main script 
  * ad the user inputs and options
  * test, try, clean, sleep, repeat
  * figure out how to create a session trough the script
  * Refine and check everything

I just had the crazy idea to combine it to create a chart wich will visually show who follows who.
(Kind of like https://github.com/KiranGershenfeld/VisualizingTwitchCommunities did)
Ill defenetly do that (in a simpler way)... still its gonna need a lot of time :)
